Car price prediction
I used all of the logical features that webpage provided me, that were:

    Url
    Expiration
    Year
    Publication
    Transmission
    Brand
    Model
    Power
    Capacity
    Drive
    Mileage
    Wheel
    Carcass
    Fuel
    Photo_Urls
    Color
    Price

Some of the retrieved features were gathered for their use in the mobile application that, on the moment of writing this notebook, is yet to be developed.

Which features of car I used to feed the machine learning algorithm?
I used features that logically would make an impact to the price, and did some feature engineering for some of them that wouldn't help in their raw format.

    Year
    Publication
    Transmission
    Brand
    Model
    Power
    Capacity
    Drive
    Mileage
    Wheel
    Carcass
    Fuel
    Color
    Price

Some of the features may seem not connected with price (like color of the car), and some features may seem redundant - linearly dependable (like power of the engine and its capacity), but I will show which of the features are important, which are redundant in the subsequent series of notebooks by Statistical analysis of data.
